# points_tracker
Points Tracker is a project run by me on my Twitter account (https://twitter.com/sergiopessoa23)

This repo contains the code of this project. The project consists of analysing the performance of an input League based on team points, home points, away points, and expected points, which are calculated based on the expected goals.

- downloader.py -> file to implement utility functions to scrape data
- game_data.py -> script to get games of the input league from FBREF
- match_details.py -> script to get details from
- points tracker.ipynb -> notebook to make the views and calculate Expected Points.
